## Problem
You are the manager of a farm. You have an initial budget of 2000 €. Each year you have to take some decisions about how to invest you money, but you can do only one of the following things:
1. Buy one sheep: a sheep costs 1000 €
2. Growing wheat: when you choose this action, you spend 20 €

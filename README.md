## Usage & code structure

## Problem
You are the manager of a farm. You have an initial budget of 2000 €. Each year you have to take some decisions about how to invest you money, but you can do only one of the following things:
1. Buy one sheep: a sheep costs 1000 €
2. Growing wheat: when you choose this action, you spend 20 €

At the end of the year, you harvest the wheat and you sell your wool. Each sheep produces 1 wool unit that is sold for 10 €. Selling the harvested wheat instead gives you 50 €.
However, during the year, there is a probability that your fields are devastated by a storm. In this case, your harvest will give you 0 €.

Your manager career ends if you run out of money or, in any case, after 30 years, when you will retire.

You want to have a long and prosperous career.
